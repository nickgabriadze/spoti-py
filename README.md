# spotiPy
Spotify style class-based program with music app-related features

A few words about "loadFromFile" method in "spotipy.py". If the data is given in the same format as it's shown in the "data" file, then it's capable of reading the entire thing and creating object out if. So, basically, it all depends on the seperation. Artists are seperated by "#", albums are seperated by "%", singles are seperated by "@" and the songs are separated by "|".
